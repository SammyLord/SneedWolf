***A browser for the rest of us.***

A non-woke build of LibreWolf.


## Note to macOS users!

We don't sign binaries because that's costly. Input this into your terminal to run.

```zsh
 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Nightly.app
```

Where "/Applications/Nightly.app" is the path to your SneedWolf app file.
